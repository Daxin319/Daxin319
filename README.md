## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I fell in love with programming after I started learning in October of 2024. I'm doing some independent contracting while looking for a job at this time. Ideally writing in Go, but I'm open to Python, C, JavaScript(and TS soon), and I'm a quick learner so if you use a different lang just give me a few weeks to get up to speed. I'd ideally like to work for a small company or startup, so if you're hiring let's chat!

- Proficient:
    - Go
    - Python
- Comfortable but don't know much detail:
    - Swift
    - JavaScript
    - C
    - SQLite/Postgres
- Currently playing with:
    - TypeScript
    - x86-64 Linux Assembly (AT&T)
